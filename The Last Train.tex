\section{Vancouver}

\paragraph{}
Adam rested his head against the pillow pressed into the side of his seat, enjoying its gentle comfort. The sun was setting over the horizon and the station lights were beginning to activate, one by one. Spread thinly around the platform, the passengers were loading their bags onto the train. Final farewells were being made. Kisses, hugs and handshakes.

\paragraph{}
Around him, they chose their seats carefully. Some were in groups; most were alone. Collectively they hoped they would get their destination on time and safely, but the quiet soft night almost seemed to guarantee that. Nothing could go wrong on the one night on which all were at rest.

\paragraph{}
Adam watched as the passengers arranged themselves: a lone man took a seat at the table across the aisle from him, a mother organised her three children around the table in front of his, another man lifted his two bags into a compartment further down the carriage and a woman found her place within a book.

\paragraph{}
He stared out to the evening, as temperatures began to plummet, appreciating the dimmed lights and quiet atmosphere of the train. He'd just finished reading the weather report, deriving just one simple fact. Snow was guaranteed. For other trains that might be a problem, but not for \emph{this} train.

\paragraph{}
After a few minutes, an announcement broke the peace.

\paragraph{}
``Last call for ICR-471 leaving Vancouver." A brief pause. ``This is the last train, you don't want to miss it."

\paragraph{}
Not long after the announcement, all of the doors locked automatically.

\paragraph{}
The captain's cheery voice burst out of the speakers for a second time. ``This train is now leaving, onwards and outwards to our destinations. We're dimming the lights for your benefit; small lights are available above each seat if needed. We hope you enjoy the ride and wake up to a merry christmas on the other side."

\paragraph{}
There was a slight sensation as the train lifted upwards by the force of the magnetised rails. Then, slowly and subtly, it started to move. As promised, the lights dimmed until they were completely invisible and the darkness from outside entered the carriage, only withheld from completely filling it by the isolated glints of reading lights and computer screens.

\paragraph{}
Initially, Adam felt the train's acceleration push him back into his seat, but as it relieved he dropped into a serene deep sleep...

\section{Edmonton}

\paragraph{}
Adam woke calmly.

\paragraph{}
The carriage lights remained firmly switched off, but lights had appeared outside and the train had come to a stop.

\paragraph{}
Another station.

\paragraph{}
He immediately pulled his left arm from under the table and stared down at his watch, struggling to use the light from outside the train to see it. When he had finally discerned the time, he rotated himself and glared out the window.

\paragraph{}
A small group of passengers were again loading themselves onto the train, but he had apparently missed the goodbyes he had witnessed previously. Numerous individuals had appeared around the carriage and more were selecting their seats. By the looks of it, the train was preparing to leave.

\paragraph{}
He snatched a glance outside, firstly noticing the endless snow that had accumulated. Then he noticed the signs.

\paragraph{}
\emph{Welcome to Edmonton}

\paragraph{}
He'd been here just three days earlier. A business meeting with two young gentlemen from a company called `Marine Atlantic', who themselves were on a journey over to Newfoundland. During his brief visit he didn't find the time to tour its attractions.

\paragraph{}
Watching the new arrivals to the carriage keenly, Adam focused on a woman who was herself analysing her surroundings. He had observed, quite correctly, that the train was filling up. Whole tables were now unavailable and choosing a seat across a table facing someone was inevitable.

\paragraph{}
Counter-intuitively, his table near the beginning of the carriage was advantageous; many people passed him in pursuit of complete tables, only to find none and accept what they could find in their immediate surroundings. Adam desired to be alone, so that he could enjoy his activities, whether it would be sleeping, reading or working, without disturbance.

\paragraph{}
Adam's heart sank slightly as the woman took the seat opposite him. At the same time, he was grateful that she seemed to be alone, considering that groups had the potential to be much worse.

\paragraph{}
Realising her bag was too large to sit beside her, the woman returned to her feet and lifted it into the overhead compartment. Her bag was surprisingly small, considering the length of journey she was about to undertake.
